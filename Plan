fix login- password change prompt works, but doesn't update password but update statement seemingly executes
Add extra button/screen to change password? - added 7/30/25. Screen changes back and forth, validates if passwords match, but 
does not change password in database. Login button prompts to change password but doesn't login, causes cursor to spin. 
8/1/25 - login takes user to get password screen. Change password still does not update database. Endlessly copies login screen instead of
going to next screens. Find what causes this.
Add more screens/menus and change screens 
Calculate payroll & taxes
Create salary info table in database - done
Complete queries for info
8/4/25 - Find why application never goes past login screen. Employee and admin option screens are created with queries for displaying info. Add class and/or functions for payroll
calculations. Add support for photos.
